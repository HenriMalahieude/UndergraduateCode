1. How many total thread blocks do we use?
We use (dim*dim) / BLOCK_SIZE blocks of threads. So for 1000x1000 matrices, and a BLOCK_SIZE of 16 that's about 63x63 thread blocks.

2. Are all thread blocks full? That is, do all threads in the thread block have data to operate on?
Some threads are not used because they are outside the bounds of the matrix.

3. How can this basic Matrix Addition program be improved? (What changes do you think can be made to speed up the code?)
This basic Matrix Addition could probably be improved by batching the most amount of actions into one thread before it becomes less efficient than a normal sequential write.
For example, trying a BLOCK_SIZE of 32 instead of 16 makes the kernel function execute faster. However, there is a sweet spot because 8 and 64 make the kernel slower.
